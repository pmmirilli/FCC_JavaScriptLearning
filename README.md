# FCC_JavaScriptLearning
Meant for keeping track of whatever solutions I come up with in order to complete the challenges in freeCodeCamp.org. This one is strictly for JavaScript.

File names matches those from the challenges in https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/.

Some solutions might be overly commented, because I may need a reminder of how I acchieved that particular logic.
