# FCC_JavaScriptLearning
Meant for keeping track of whatever solutions I come up with in order to complete the challenges in freeCodeCamp.org. This one is strictly for JavaScript.

File names matches those from the challenges in https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/, preceded by the initials of the section to which the challenge belongs. Full name of the corresponding section and challenge index can be found under the file description of the first version.

Some solutions might be overly commented, because I may need a reminder of how I acchieved that particular logic.
