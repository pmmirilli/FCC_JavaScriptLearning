# FCC_JavaScriptLearning
Meant for keeping track of whatever solutions I come up with in order to complete the challenges at freeCodeCamp.org. This one is strictly for JavaScript.

File names match those from the challenges at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/, preceded by the initials of the section to which the challenge belongs. Full name of the corresponding section and challenge index can be found under the file description of the first version.

It is important to note that I try to remember every lesson and solve all challenges exclusively from what I learned, without referring to:
  1 - any documentation;
  2 - other people's code snippets;
  3 - hints from freeCodeCamp's Challenge Guides;
  4 - solutions from the aforementioned guides.
  
Of course, that is not always possible. I sometimes will refer to at least one of the above items, in the mentioned order, to achieve a result. After I complete a challenge -mostly - by myself, in order to improve my code, I will go through all of these and rewrite everything anew. Some solutions might be overly commented, because I may need a reminder of how I came up with - or copied and understood - that particular logic.

Although counterproductive, this approach is aimed exclusively at learning, rather than just getting it done.
